# Manager-Client-Telegram-Bot

This project implements a Telegram-based system for managing user requests and approvals. It uses Google Sheets as a central database, accessed via a Google Service Account for authentication and secure read/write operations. Two Telegram bots are integrated: a Client Bot that allows users to check their status and login, and a Manager Bot that enables administrators to review, accept, or reject requests directly from Telegram. All interactions with Google Sheets are handled programmatically, ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between users and administrators.
